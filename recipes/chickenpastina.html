    <p>Chef John's chicken pastina is like a big, warm hug from an Italian grandma, a comfort food that will, quite literally, change your mood.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups prepared chicken broth</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup stelline/stelle (star shaped) pastina, or other pastina such as acini di pepe </li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3/4 cup finely grated parmigiano reggiano cheese (1 1/2 ounces by weight)</li>
        <li>extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring broth to a simmer over medium-high heat. Taste; season with salt if needed.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium, and stir in pastina. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 30 seconds less than the package directions, 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn off heat, and stir in black pepper, butter, and grated cheese. Stir constantly until butter disappears.</li>
        <li>Ladle pastina into hot bowls, top with more freshly ground black pepper and parmigiano reggiano, and drizzle with olive oil.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Chef's Note:</h4>
        <p>For a brothier, soupier version reduce the amount of pastina used. For a thicker, risotto-like  version, use more pastina. 
            If you have time, you can make a fortified broth as shown in the video. Simmer raw, bone-in chicken parts in a quart of store-bought chicken broth, plus 3 cups water, until chicken is tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Add onions, carrots, celery, garlic cloves, and a bay leaf for more flavor if desired. Remove chicken meat and reserve to use in the soup or other dishes. Strain broth and reserve until needed.</p>
